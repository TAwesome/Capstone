            Hello! My name is Jill and on this project the technologies I worked with were JavaScript, jQuery, Laravel, PHP and also a little CSS and HTML. My main role on with SkyLanguage was working with the routes, controllers, uploading features, modals and linking together the database with the CSS and helping to create a fully functioning site.
